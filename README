In general, the code in this repository tries to use available 
memory bandwith in you computer to communicate information between
processes.


The sender modulates the shared resource "memory-bandwith" by 
periodicall performing memcpy like operations.

The sender continously monitors the avalable memory bandwidth by 
constantly performing memcpy-like operations and measuring the
time it took.
